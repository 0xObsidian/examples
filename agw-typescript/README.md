# Abstract Global Wallet with TypeScript

This example demonstrates how to use the [agw-client](https://docs.abs.xyz/abstract-global-wallet/agw-client/overview)
in a simple TypeScript setup.

## Local Development

1. Get a copy of the `agw-typescript` example directory from the Abstract Examples repository:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p agw-typescript && curl -L https://codeload.github.com/Abstract-Foundation/examples/tar.gz/main | tar -xz --strip=2 -C agw-typescript examples-main/agw-typescript && cd agw-typescript
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the TypeScript example

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

This will execute the script that demonstrates creating an AGW client, deploying the AGW smart contract (if not already deployed), and sending a transaction through it.
